All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic
Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) except to the first release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## v2.4.2 - 2026-02-17

The patch release with fixes from static analyzer.

### Fixed

- Fix similar branches in decimal/bcd.go detected by Svacer static
  analyzer (#533).

## [v2.4.1] - 2025-10-16

This maintenance release marks the end of active development on the `v2`
branch.

## [v2.4.0] - 2025-07-11

This release focuses on adding schema/user/session operations, synchronous transaction
flag handling, and fixes watcher panic.

### Added

- Implemented all box.schema.user operations requests and sugar interface (#426).
- Implemented box.session.su request and sugar interface only for current session granting (#426).
- Defined `ErrConcurrentSchemaUpdate` constant for "concurrent schema update" error (#404).
  Now you can check this error with `errors.Is(err, tarantool.ErrConcurrentSchemaUpdate)`.
- Implemented support for `IPROTO_IS_SYNC` flag in stream transactions,
  added `IsSync(bool)` method for `BeginRequest`/`CommitRequest` (#447).

### Fixed

- Fixed panic when calling NewWatcher() during reconnection or after
  connection is closed (#438).

## [v2.3.2] - 2025-04-14

This release improves the logic of `Connect` and `pool.Connect` in case of a
hung I/O connection.

### Changed

- Previously, `pool.Connect` attempted to establish a connection one after
  another instance. It could cause the entire chain to hang if one connection
  hanged. Now connections are established in parallel. After the first
  successful connection, the remaining connections wait with a timeout of
  `pool.Opts.CheckTimeout` (#444).

### Fixed

- Connect() may not cancel Dial() call on context expiration if network
  connection hangs (#443).
- pool.Connect() failed to connect to any instance if a first instance
  connection hangs (#444).

## [v2.3.1] - 2025-04-03

The patch releases fixes expected Connect() behavior and reduces allocations.

### Added

- A usage of sync.Pool of msgpack.Decoder saves 2 object allocations per
  a response decoding (#440).

### Changed

- Connect() now retry the connection if a failure occurs and opts.Reconnect > 0.
  The number of attempts is equal to opts.MaxReconnects or unlimited if
  opts.MaxReconnects == 0. Connect() blocks until a connection is established,
  the context is cancelled, or the number of attempts is exhausted (#436).

## [v2.3.0] - 2025-03-11

The release extends box.info responses and ConnectionPool.GetInfo return data.

Be careful, we have changed the test_helpers package a little since we do not
support backward compatibility for it.

### Added

- Extend box with replication information (#427).
- The Instance info has been added to ConnectionInfo for ConnectionPool.GetInfo
  response (#429).
- Added helpers to run Tarantool config storage (#431).

### Changed

- Changed helpers API `StartTarantool` and `StopTarantool`, now it uses
  pointer on `TarantoolInstance`:
  * `StartTarantool()` returns `*TarantoolInstance`;
  * `StopTarantool()` and `StopTarantoolWithCleanup()` accepts
    `*TarantoolInstance` as arguments.
- Field `Cmd` in `TarantoolInstance` struct declared as deprecated.
  Suggested `Wait()`, `Stop()` and `Signal()` methods as safer to use
  instead of direct `Cmd.Process` access (#431).

### Fixed

- Test helpers does not detect a fail to start a Tarantool instance if
  another Tarantool instance already listens a port (#431).

## [v2.2.1] - 2024-12-17

The release fixes a schema lost after a reconnect.

### Fixed

- `unable to use an index name because schema is not loaded` error after
  a reconnect (#424).

## [v2.2.0] - 2024-12-16

The release introduces the IPROTO_INSERT_ARROW request (arrow.InsertRequest)
and a request to archive `box.info` values (box.InfoRequest). Additionally, it
includes some improvements to logging.

### Added

- Error logging to `ConnectionPool.Add()` in case, when unable to establish
  connection and ctx is not canceled (#389).
- Error logging for error case of `ConnectionPool.tryConnect()` calls in
  `ConnectionPool.controller()` and `ConnectionPool.reconnect()` (#389).
- Methods that are implemented but not included in the pooler interface (#395).
- Implemented stringer methods for pool.Role (#405).
- Support the IPROTO_INSERT_ARROW request (#399).
- A simple implementation of using the box interface (#410).

### Changed

- More informative request canceling: log the probable reason for unexpected
  request ID and add request ID info to context done error message (#407).

## [v2.1.0] - 2024-03-06

The small release improves the ConnectionPool. The ConnectionPool now does not
require execute access for `box.info` from a user for Tarantool >= 3.0.0.

### Changed

- `execute` access for `box.info` is no longer required for ConnectionPool
  for a Tarantool version >= 3.0.0 (#380).

### Fixed

- `ConnectionPool.Remove()` does not notify a `ConnectionHandler` after
  an instance is already removed from the pool (#385).

## [v2.0.0] - 2024-02-12

There are a lot of changes in the new major version. The main ones:

* The `go_tarantool_call_17` build tag is no longer needed, since by default
  the `CallRequest` is `Call17Request`.
* The `go_tarantool_msgpack_v5` build tag is no longer needed, since only the
  `msgpack/v5` library is used.
* The `go_tarantool_ssl_disable` build tag is no longer needed, since the
  connector is no longer depends on `OpenSSL` by default. You could use the
  external library [go-tlsdialer](https://github.com/tarantool/go-tlsdialer) to
  create a connection with the `ssl` transport.
* Required Go version is `1.20` now.
* The `Connect` function became more flexible. It now allows to create a
  connection with cancellation and a custom `Dialer` implementation.
* It is required to use `Request` implementation types with the `Connection.Do`
  method instead of `Connection.<Request>` methods.
* The `connection_pool` package renamed to `pool`.

See the [migration guide](./MIGRATION.md) for more details.

  to get specific info.
  Special types of responses are used with special requests.
- `IsPush()` method is added to the response iterator (#237). It returns
  the information if the current response is a `PushResponse`.
  `PushCode` constant is removed.
- Method `Get` for `Future` now returns response data (#237). To get the actual
  response new `GetResponse` method has been added. Methods `AppendPush` and

  the pool even it is unable to connect to it (#372).
- Required Go version updated from `1.13` to `1.20` (#378).
